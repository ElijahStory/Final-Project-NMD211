Below is a picture of all the wiring involved for the GY-521 Module. The vcc gets 5V power, the gnd is connected to ground, the SCL on the GY-521 connects to the SCL on the Arduino, likewise the SDA is connected on both boards.

When using the “controller”, the side of the GY-521 board with the pins needs to point to the right side of the monitor. The VCC pin on the GY-521 needs to be closer to the user and away from the monitor. This gives us the proper orientation and will make the penguin move in the direction desired.
